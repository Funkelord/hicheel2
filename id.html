        Great Britain has produced some of the most potent - and often beautiful
        - fighter aircraft ever flown.
      </h1>
      <p>
        The pivotal moment in the story of the British fighter aircraft was the
        Battle of Britain in 1940 when the Royal Air Force valiantly deterred
        the marauding Luftwaffe of Nazi Germany. Narrowing this list down to
        down to 10 was hard, and given a further ten, I would have loved to have
        included the Gloster Gladiator (304 victories despite its obsolescence)
        and the most successful Fleet Air Arm fighter of the second world war,
        the Fairey Fulmar, a mediocre machine that achieved incredible things.
        Many more deserve a mention, like the S.E.5 from the first world war.
        We're not including international joint-ventures like the Eurofighter
        Typhoon. Here are ten superb British fighter aircraft:

        Recent combat footage has shown a Russian BTR-82A armored personnel

      <h1>Adolf Hitler</h1>
      <p>
        Adolf Hitler (20 April 1889 – 30 April 1945) was an Austrian-born German
        politician who was the dictator of Nazi Germany from 1933 until his
        suicide in 1945. He rose to power as the leader of the Nazi Party,
        becoming the chancellor in 1933 and then taking the title of Führer und
        Reichskanzler in 1934.
